*Purpose*: The most powerful way for us to learn about a dataset is to
_visualize the data_. Throughout this class we will make extensive use of the
_grammar of graphics_, a powerful graphical programming _grammar_ that will
allow us to create just about any graph you can imagine!

*Reading*: [Data Visualization Basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.1). *Note*: In RStudio use `Ctrl + Click` (Mac `Command + Click`) to follow the link.
*Topics*: `Welcome`, `A code template`, `Aesthetic mappings`.
*Reading Time*: ~ 30 minutes


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

__q1__ Load the `tidyverse` and inspect the `diamonds` dataset. What do the
`cut`, `color`, and `clarity` variables mean?

Ans: Cut is categorical, quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

Color is categorical, the color of the diamonds from D (best) to J (worst)

*Hint*: We learned how to inspect a dataset in `e-data-00-basics`!

```{r library echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
diamonds %>% glimpse()
?diamonds

```

__q2__ Use your "standard checks" to determine what variables the dataset has.

```{r checks}
diamonds %>% head
```

Now that we have the list of variables in the dataset, we know what we can visualize!

__q3__ Using `ggplot`, visualize `price` vs `carat` with points. What trend do
you observe?



*Hint*: Usually the language `y` vs `x` refers to the `vertical axis` vs
`horizontal axis`. This is the opposite order from the way we often specify `x,
y` pairs. Language is hard!

```{r q3-task}
## TODO: Complete this code
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=carat, y=price))
```

**Observations**:

Ans: Price appears to increase as carat value increases.There is low variability from 0 to 1 carats and high variability in price when carat is greater than 1.

__q4__ Create a new graph to visualize `price`, `carat`, and `cut`
simultaneously.

*Hint*: Remember that you can add additional aesthetic mappings in `aes()`. Some options include `size`, `color`, and `shape`.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO: Complete this code
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut))
```

**Observations**:

It appears that all carat levels have the different qualities of cut, i.e. not all low carat values are poor quality cut and not all high carat values are high quality cut.  Overall, it appears that low quality cuts are lower priced.
