*Purpose*: Your ability to get stuff done is highly dependent on your fluency
with your tools. One aspect of fluency is knowing and *using* keyboard
shortcuts. In this exercise, we'll go over some of the most important ones.

*Reading*: [Keyboard
shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts); [Code Chunk Options](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)
*Note*: Use this reading to look up answers to the questions below. Rather than
*memorizing* this information, I recommend you download a
[cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf),
and either print it out or save it in a convenient place on your computer. Get
used to referencing your cheatsheets while doing data science---practice makes
perfect!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

__q1__ What do the following keyboard shortcuts do?

* Within the script editor or a chunk

    * `Alt` + `-`  
    insert an assignment operator


    * `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `M`
    insert a pipe operator 


    * `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter` run current line of code


    * `F1` (Note: on a Mac you need to press `fn` + `F1`) show help for the function at the cursor


* Within R Markdown

    * `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I` insert chunk of R code


* Within a chunk

    * `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter` Source the current document (with echo)


__q2__ For a chunk, what header option do you use to

* Run the code, don't display it, but show its results? -> echo


* Run the code, but don't display it or its results? -> include


__q3__ How do stop the code in a chunk from running once it has started? -> Stop button
